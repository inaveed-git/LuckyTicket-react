# Lottery App

Welcome to the Lottery App repository! This application allows users to participate in a virtual lottery by purchasing tickets and checking if they have won. It's a fun project to demonstrate React.js concepts and basic web development skills.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Used for building the user interface components and managing application state.
- **CSS**: Styled components using CSS to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the application.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Used for logic implementation, such as generating random tickets and calculating winning conditions.
- **Vite**: Development server and build tool for modern web development.
